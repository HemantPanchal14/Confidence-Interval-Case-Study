Learning Confidence Interval - DATA SCIENCE

A confidence interval displays the probability that a parameter will fall between a pair of values around the mean.
Confidence intervals measure the degree of uncertainty or certainty in a sampling method.
They are most often constructed using confidence levels of 95% or 99%.

z-statistics (z-score) is used when the data follows a normal distribution, population standard deviation ( σ ) is known and the sample size is above 30. 

Z-Score tells you how many standard deviations from the mean your result is. The z-score is calculated using the formula:

 

t-statistics (t-score), also known as Student's T-Distribution, is used when the data follows a normal distribution,
population standard deviation ( σ ) is NOT known, but the sample standard deviation ( s ) is known or can be calculated, and the sample size is below 30. T-Score tells you how many standard deviations from the mean your result is. The t-score is calculated using the formula:
